# Day 1 – Python Basics & First Mini Project

## 🔥 What I Learned:
- Python variables and data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Taking user input using `input()`
- Output using `print()` and formatting with `f-strings`
- Simple arithmetic operations
- Basic use of the `random` module

---

## ✅ Practice Tasks:
- Input and greet user by name and age
- Simple calculator for two numbers
- Celsius to Fahrenheit temperature converter
- Type checking and usage of different data types

## 🛠️ Mini Project – Number Guessing Game (v1):
This is a simple game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user tries to guess it.

### 🎮 Features:
- Generates a random number using `random.randint()`
- Takes user input as a guess
- Displays whether the guess is correct or not

### 📌 To Run:
```bash
python guess_game.py
